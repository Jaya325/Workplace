- Threads of execution, often shortened to threads, are the objects of activity within the process. Each thread includes a unique program counter, process stack, and set of processor registers.The kernel schedules individual threads, not processes.
- a thread is merely a process that shares certain resources with other processes. Each thread has a unique task_struct and appears to the kernel as a normal processâ€”
threads just happen to share resources, such as an address space, with other processes.
- To create a thread
```
clone(CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND, 0);
```
- To clear a thread
```
clone();
```
