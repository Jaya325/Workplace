// Encapsulation
/*  Encapsulation is binding together the data and functions that manipulates those data.
- > suppose we have class in that class we have data members and member function then we can call it as encapsulation */

Eg: 

#include<iostream.h>
using namespace std;
class base{
  int x;
public:
  void setx(int a){x=a;}
  int getx(){return x}
};
int main()
{
  // do some code....
  return 0;
}
